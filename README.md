+ Project summary: 

This project we tried to build some models to recognize and classify the landmark. For those who are intrested in taking pictures of everthying, it could be really helpful to recognize the landmarks they pictured and remined them their name!

We did this project doing base and advanced model. For the base model, we extractd the HOG features and then used SGD to classify them. 
For advance model, first we used a 3 layered CNN and check the test and train accuracy. Second, we used a pretrained model of Xception and extracted features, and then used a 3 layered fully connected network for classification.

You can find our presentation [here](doc/project5_group04.pdf). Also, the main file is [here](doc/Main.pdf).
